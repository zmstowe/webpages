    <p>Venus is a fascinating planet because, even though it's similar in size to Earth, its environment is extremely different. Its thick atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and causes a "runaway greenhouse effect," making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. The planet is covered by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, and it has a strange rotation: it spins in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning a day on Venus is longer than a year. These extreme conditions make Venus stand out as one of the most unique and hostile planets in our solar system.</p>

    <p>Newtonâ€™s thought experiment for getting into orbit imagines firing a cannonball from a very tall mountain. If the cannonball is fired slowly, it will fall to the ground, but as the speed increases, the cannonball travels farther, eventually reaching a point where it would fall around the Earth instead of back to the surface. This is essentially how objects can stay in orbit, by moving fast enough that they constantly fall toward the planet but never actually hit it. The points where a spacecraft's orbit is closest and farthest from the planet are called periapsis and apoapsis, respectively. The periapsis is the closest point to the planet, while the apoapsis is the farthest point in the orbit.</p>
